## Release Process

To make a release, you first need to ensure that the released version will either be a semver minor or patch release so that automatic updates are working for our users. Following that, the process is simple:

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` so that the unreleased section gets its version number. Commit and push this change.
- Run either `npm version minor` or `npm version patch`.
- Acquire an OTP token for 2fa of npmjs.com
- run `npm publish`
